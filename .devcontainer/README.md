Please use it for being able to tell "It works on my machine".

**Docker is required to be installed on your machine!**

## Development Container Issues

If you encounter an issue with setting up a development container, please
try to rebuild it first before opening a GitHub Issue. It's not uncommon
that some issues may fix themselves after a fresh container rebuild.
